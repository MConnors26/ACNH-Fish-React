This is my first React project. It is a work in progress and I will continue to modify until it is working exactly as I want. Much of this project setup was based on the project that Tech with Tim featured in his Youtube video about learning React with one project. That video is linked below. My goal is to use this project to understand the fundamentals of React and to move on to more advanced concepts in subsequent projects.

# React + Vite

This template provides a minimal setup to get React working in Vite with HMR and some ESLint rules.

Currently, two official plugins are available:

- [@vitejs/plugin-react](https://github.com/vitejs/vite-plugin-react/blob/main/packages/plugin-react/README.md) uses [Babel](https://babeljs.io/) for Fast Refresh
- [@vitejs/plugin-react-swc](https://github.com/vitejs/vite-plugin-react-swc) uses [SWC](https://swc.rs/) for Fast Refresh
